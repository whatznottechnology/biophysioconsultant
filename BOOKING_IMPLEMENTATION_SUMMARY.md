## 🐛 Debugging

### Browser Console Logging

All booking steps are logged:
```javascript
console.log('Form data:'); // Shows all form fields
console.log('Response status:', response.status); // HTTP status
console.log('Response data:', data); // Server response
console.log('Booking successful! Redirecting to:', url); // Success
console.error('Booking failed:', error); // Errors
```

### Server Console Logging

Check terminal for:
```python
Debug: Starting form_valid - payment_method=..., payment_id=...
Debug: User authenticated: user@email.com
Debug: User profile updated
Debug: Payment completed - payment_id=pay_xxx
Debug: Booking saved successfully - ID: xxx-xxx-xxx
Debug: Returning JSON response: {...}
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Booking failed" error
**Solution:** Check browser console for exact error. Check server terminal for backend errors.

#### Issue: Phone validation fails
**Solution:** Enter exactly 10 digits (no spaces, no +91, no dashes)

#### Issue: Payment succeeds but booking fails
**Solution:** Check webhook is configured. Payment will still process, update booking manually in admin.

#### Issue: File upload fails
**Solution:** Ensure file is under 5MB and in PDF/JPG/PNG format. File upload only works for logged-in users.

#### Issue: Modal doesn't show
**Solution:** Check if email is properly filled in step 2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors.

## 📝 Notes

1. **Webhook URL, Success URL, Failure URL** in admin are OPTIONAL. The system works without them:
   - Webhook URL: For automatic payment status updates (recommended but not required)
   - Success URL: Handled by frontend redirect
   - Failure URL: Handled by frontend error handling

2. **User Data**: All bookings save user data:
   - Logged-in users: Booking linked to user account
   - Guest users: Booking saved without user link, data stored in booking record

3. **File Uploads**: Only work for logged-in users (PrescriptionUpload model requires patient FK)

4. **Payment Flow**: 
   - Online → Create order → Open Razorpay → Verify → Submit booking
   - Pay at Clinic → Direct booking submission

5. **Auto User Creation**: When new user selects online payment and registers, account is automatically created and user is logged in before payment.
