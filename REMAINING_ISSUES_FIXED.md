## 🔍 Additional Issues Fixed

### Issue #6: Missing selectedService Validation ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem:** `initiateOnlinePayment()` was accessing `selectedService` without checking if it exists.

**Potential Impact:** 
- If somehow selectedService is null/undefined → JavaScript error
- `Cannot read property 'price' of null`

**Fix:**
```javascript
function initiateOnlinePayment() {
    // Validate selectedService exists
    if (!selectedService) {
        alert('Please select a service first');
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of code
}
```

### Issue #7: Missing Razorpay Script Check ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem:** Code assumes Razorpay script is loaded but doesn't verify.

**Potential Impact:**
- If script fails to load from CDN → `Razorpay is not defined` error
- User sees cryptic error instead of helpful message

**Fix:**
```javascript
if (typeof Razorpay === 'undefined') {
    alert('Payment gateway not loaded. Please refresh the page and try again.');
    return;
}
```
